# Everything iNiR needs on NixOS that isn't pulled in automatically.
# `inir doctor` reports most of these as "missing" because it assumes an
# Arch-style package manager; on NixOS they have to be declared here.
#
# Every package below was added to fix a REAL crash or missing feature,
# confirmed by hand against `inir logs --full` / `journalctl --user -u inir`.
# The "optional" block at the end is taste, not requirement — trim freely.
